This code was made to export the data from Sports Tracker to an Excel file, so that it could be further analyzed, as plotting possibilities on Sports Tracker (at least in the free version of the app) are very limited. So with this generated Excel file, you can play with your data more easily.
Hope you'll enjoy it and don't hesitate to contact me if you enconter difficulties running the code :)
